                <h1>Happy Mother's Day!!</h1>
                <p> Being blessed with the best mom ever is pretty hard and amazing. I've never seen someone that's
                    so humble, loving, selfless, and hardworking, because of you I try to see the good in people and
                    help others. The love you have for us and others is incredible. It's because of you that I will never give up,
                    and I'll always keep living my life to te fullest! I'm truly thankful for everything you have taught me, It's
                    because of you that I am who I am today. I hope one day soon I can surpass every expectation, and pay it back!
                    I have never seen or heard about a mom that would sacrifice as much as you have, and will always cherrish the trips,
                    and all of our memories together. There's no word to say how much I love you or how grateful I am to be your son.
                    Happy Mother's Day!!! I wish there was more I could say or do, to truly show you how much you mean to me. <br>
                    Love Dakoda, <br>
                    Happy Mother's Day!!!!
                </p>
